# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description

for this assignment I needed to create the backend and then connect it to the front end to create and display the new notes. This was a challenging assignment at first and I was pretty lost, but looking back through the class activities i was able to really piece togther what I needed to write in the app. The app is designed to be a note taking app. When you enter a note title and then note text you c an save the note to a list. The user is also able to create a new note or delete notes.
